DARPA-BAA-13-37,,09/17/2013,Award,"DARPA's Living Foundries: 1000 Molecules program seeks to build a scalable, integrated, rapid design and prototyping infrastructure for the facile engineering of biology. This infrastructure will enable transformative and currently inaccessible projects to develop advanced chemicals, materials, sensing capabilities, and therapeutics. Furthermore, the infrastructure will provide a flexible, efficient, and continuously improving capability to Department of Defense (DoD) and the engineering biology community. A final proof-of-principle demonstration of capabilities will require rapid design and prototyping centers to generate 1000 novel molecules and chemical building blocks, thus enabling access to radical new materials.",https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=7610634cc3cbcbb826407a0d208c2515&tab=core&_cview=1,True,Living Foundries: 1000 Molecules
