# fbo_scraper
A scraper to retrieve DARPA funding opportunities from FedBizOpps.gov

[Currently under active development, so the information below may not yet all be true.]

This scraper uses the Scrapy framework for Python. The existing DARPA spider can be easily cloned and adapted to scrape funding opportunities for any other agency (see code).
