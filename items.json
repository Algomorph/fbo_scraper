The GXV-T effort will investigate ground vehicle technologies that enable a next
generation of ground vehicles that improve survivability and mobility. This will be accomplished through research and development of novel ground combat and tactical vehicle technology solutions resulting in significantly advanced platform mobility, agility, and survivability. Technology development is the core of the GXV-T program. The Government seeks solutions across a range of technology areas, including the design, development, testing, and evaluation of technologies at the subsystem level. Solutions are to be matured from concepts to a\u00a0 subsystem demonstration by the end of the program.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals of interest to the Biological Technologies Office (BTO). Proposed research should investigate leading edge approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, technologies, or systems at the intersection of biology with engineering and the physical and computer sciences. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of the art. BTO seeks unconventional approaches that are outside the mainstream, challenge assumptions, and have the potential to radically change established practice, lead to extraordinary outcomes, and create entirely new fields.
\u00a0
The mission of BTO is to foster, demonstrate, and transition breakthrough fundamental research, discoveries, and applications that integrate biology, engineering, computer science, mathematics, and the physical sciences to expand the national security toolkit. BTO's investment portfolio goes far beyond life sciences applications in medicine to include areas of research such as human-machine interfaces, microbes as production platforms, and deep exploration of the impact of evolving ecologies and environments on U.S. readiness and capabilities. BTO's programs operate across a wide range of scales, from individual cells to the warfighter to global ecosystems. BTO responds to the urgent and long-term needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and addresses national security priorities. The overarching goal is to develop, demonstrate, and transition biological- based technologies as part of the toolkit available to DARPA stakeholders.
\u00a0
BTO is seeking novel approaches that will build technical communities that tap into sources of innovation both inside and outside traditional DoD performer communities. BTO encourages efforts that are creative and agile both in terms of the technologies proposed and in the structure of the approach.

The DARPA RAM Replay program is interested in investigating memory replay with respect to the consolidation of episodic memories and newly learned skills, and how these memories are recalled and utilized by humans during subsequent task performance.
Respondents to this BAA must propose novel approaches to quantitatively model various parameters associated with human memory replay, and to utilize this model in the development of interventions that assess quality of replay and enable and improve associated memory recall during operationally relevant tasks.\u00a0 See Attachment for complete BAA requirements.

\n\t\tDARPA's Living Foundries: 1000 Molecules program seeks to build a scalable, integrated, rapid design and prototyping infrastructure for the facile engineering of biology. This infrastructure will enable transformative and currently inaccessible projects to develop advanced chemicals, materials, sensing capabilities, and therapeutics. Furthermore, the infrastructure will provide a flexible, efficient, and continuously improving capability to Department of Defense (DoD) and the engineering biology community. A final proof-of-principle demonstration of capabilities will require rapid design and prototyping centers to generate 1000 novel molecules and chemical building blocks, thus enabling access to radical new materials.

\n\t\tAmendment 05: The purpose of Amendment 05 is to revise the \"Response Date\" stipulated on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website/page for Broad Agency Announcement No. DARPA-BAA-13-37 to match the closing date currently listed in the BAA (21 October 2014).  The extension of the FBO \"Response Date\" is primarily to allow the BAA to remain active on FBO website so that TA2 proposals can be submitted per guidance/requirements stipulated in the BAA.  However, as currently depicted in the BAA, full proposals for TA1 and Advanced Studies submitted after the 8 October 2013 due date (initial round of selections) may be reviewed and selected contingent upon the availability of funds (although the likelihood of availability of funding is greatly reduced for TA1 and Advanced Studies proposals submitted after the initial due date of 8 October 2013). For further clarification - NO changes have been made to the BAA - only to the \"Response Date\" established on the FBO website/page for this BAA.\n\n\t\tAdded: Mar 13, 2014 4:03 pm
