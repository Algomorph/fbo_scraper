The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals of interest to the Biological Technologies Office (BTO). Proposed research should investigate leading edge approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, technologies, or systems at the intersection of biology with engineering and the physical and computer sciences. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of the art. BTO seeks unconventional approaches that are outside the mainstream, challenge assumptions, and have the potential to radically change established practice, lead to extraordinary outcomes, and create entirely new fields.
\u00a0
The mission of BTO is to foster, demonstrate, and transition breakthrough fundamental research, discoveries, and applications that integrate biology, engineering, computer science, mathematics, and the physical sciences to expand the national security toolkit. BTO's investment portfolio goes far beyond life sciences applications in medicine to include areas of research such as human-machine interfaces, microbes as production platforms, and deep exploration of the impact of evolving ecologies and environments on U.S. readiness and capabilities. BTO's programs operate across a wide range of scales, from individual cells to the warfighter to global ecosystems. BTO responds to the urgent and long-term needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and addresses national security priorities. The overarching goal is to develop, demonstrate, and transition biological- based technologies as part of the toolkit available to DARPA stakeholders.
\u00a0
BTO is seeking novel approaches that will build technical communities that tap into sources of innovation both inside and outside traditional DoD performer communities. BTO encourages efforts that are creative and agile both in terms of the technologies proposed and in the structure of the approach.

POCs: Dr. Robert Hummel (DARPA/IXO), FAX 703/696-2201/2203; Mr. Alan Frederick (DARPA/CMO), FAX: (703) 807-1728.\r\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for the development of novel and efficient techniques for rapidly exploiting 3-D sensor data to precisely locate and recognize targets. This procurement has three separate technology areas: Modeling, Target Acquisition, and Target Recognition.  The Modeling area seeks solutions for constructing and inserting target, clutter, and decoy models into the E3D system.  The Target Acquisition area seeks solutions for detecting and segmenting targets contained in a local block of 3-D data.  The Target Recognition area seeks solutions for analyzing segmented 3-D data blocks to determine target class, identity, and fingerprint. One award is anticipated in the Modeling area.  Two awards each are anticipated in the Target Acquisition and Target Recognition areas.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND: Sensors that provide 3-D information provide an opportunity to achieve precision recognition in the targeting process.  Whereas identification from 2-D images requires complex inferencing of 3-D information from 2-D scenes, precise identification from 3-D data should be achievable based on measurements obtained directly from the sensor data.  Accordingly, by making use of the 3-D data rapidly becoming available from advanced sensors, the E3D project should provide a quantum leap in the military's ability to perform targeting.  Additionally, E3D exploitation technology should drive the introduction of new 3-D sensors by creating a lucrative market for the use of 3-D data.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES: The E3D project will develop technology to detect and recognize vehicular targets in 3-D data.  In the context of E3D, -recognition- means the labeling of an object in terms of class type, target type, and unique identity. The primary goals of the E3D project are 1) demonstrate that 3-D shape and structure of targets, together with spatial 3-D information about the context of the targets, can permit confident recognition over broad ranges of obscuration, configuration variation, and environment complexity, 2) demonstrate that 3-D shape and structure of targets, together with spatial 3-D information about the context of the targets, can permit confident decoy mitigation, and 3) working extensively with simulation data, identify requirements for 3-D resolution and target features for the purpose of performing acquisition, classification, identification, as well as -fingerprinting,- of targets according to their 3-D features.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL APPROACH: Modeling, Target Acquisition, and Target Recognition technology will be developed in three phases.  A fourth phase is planned, but is not included as part of this solicitation. Phase I and Phase II will last 12 months each, and Phase III and Phase IV will last 9 months each.  In Phase I, the Modeling technology area will develop techniques for rapidly creating and inserting models of accessible targets.  These techniques will be used to build 75 target identification models and 20 target class models.  The Target Acquisition and Recognition technology areas will develop techniques to locate and recognize articulating, reconfigurable targets under partial obscuration conditions, with an identification probability of 0.85, a target rejection rate less than 5%, and a processing time of 3 minutes per target or less.  In Phase II, the Modeling technology area will develop techniques for rapidly creating and inserting models of denied targets and clutter.   The target model library will be expanded to 150 target identification models and 50 target class models. The Target Acquisition and Recognition technology areas will develop techniques to locate and recognize articulating, reconfigurable targets in close proximity under 50% obscuration conditions in clutter containing primitivedecoys, with an identification probability of 0.9, a target rejection rate less than 3%, and a processing time of 5-times real time. In Phase III, the Modeling technology area will develop techniques for rapidly creating and inserting class models of denied targets and clutter -on the fly-.   The target model library will be expanded to 300 target identification models and 100 target class models.  The Target Acquisition and Recognition technology areas will develop techniques to locate and recognize articulating, reconfigurable targets in close proximity under 50% obscuration conditions in clutter containing complex decoys, with an identification probability of 0.95, a target rejection rate less than 2%, and real-time processing speeds.  The E3D project will provide clear and unambiguous milestones with well-defined performance metrics that allow the Government to determine progress towards achieving or exceeding project objectives. The results at the conclusion of each Phase will provide the basis for Go/No-Go decision for the subsequent Phase. E3D technologies will be evaluated and tested in Government facilities. Performers will be required to provide electronic reporting via the DARPA Technical - Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS).\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFORMATION: Further information on the technical approach can be found in the Proposal Information Pamphlet (PIP) at the web site http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/e3d/.

{"sponsor_number": "BAA05-20", "office": "", "check_date": false, "synopsis": "Added:\r\nFebruary 25, 2005\r\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of linear photonic radio frequency (RF) front-ends supporting the need for extremely high dynamic range microwave receivers.  Proposed research should investigate innovative microwave photonic transmission approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.\r\nThe objective of PHOR-FRONT is to develop and demonstrate intrinsically linear, high sensitivity optical transmission techniques which can serve as the analog front-end of a digital microwave receiver.  A key objective is to replace conventional electronic low-noise amplifiers, mixers and copper cables with highly linear microwave photonic links providing RF gain, low Noise Figure (NF), frequency down-conversion to Intermediate Frequency (IF) or baseband, and most importantly, extremely high two-tone Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR).  With the understanding that processing wideband RF antenna signals into High Dynamic Range (HDR) digital bit streams is an important military thrust, this development serves to provide the critical optoelectronic (OE) infrastructure allowing a universal RF front-end that enables remote HDR digital processing.  This solicitation specifically addresses the development of the OE modules deemed most critical to achieving the targeted bandwidth, SFDR and NF requirements for transmission and down-conversion of microwave antenna signals.  The use of 1550 nm wavelength coherent optical transmission techniques incorporating LINEAR Phase Modulation (PM) and LINEAR phase demodulation is highly desirable and considered an attractive approach in achieving the required NF and SFDR.  As such, the 1550 nm coherent optical oscillator and the linear phase demodulator, e.g. a balanced optical mixer phase-locked-loop discriminator, are considered the most critical modules necessary to achieve this goal.  Optical phase modulation at the transmitter side, although necessary, is considered a lower risk element of the photonic front-end and not considered part of this solicitation.  The back-end analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is also not addressed in this solicitation; however, the proposed photonic RF front-end approaches should be fully compatible with HDR ADC back-end implementations.  In fact, the OE module flow-down requirements have been aligned with projected (less than 10 year) ADC performance levels for bandwidth and resolution.\r\n\r\nThe targeted end-of-program performance goal is to provide at least 90 dB of 2-tone SFDR in a 500 MHz Instantaneous Bandwidth (IBW), at any center frequency within the desired operating frequency range of 0.5-18 GHz.  This multi-octave range of RF signals will result from multiple antenna outputs, and it can be assumed that the frequency band of each antenna covers less than an octave.  A photonic RF front-end NF of 3 dB is targeted in association with the SFDR goal.   It is envisioned that PHOR-FRONT will enable a dramatic leap in performance for applications such as channelized Electronic Warfare (EW) receivers.  In this example application, each antenna feed would be applied to individual PHOR-FRONT links, which in turn provide input signals for individual receiver systems.\r\n\r\nFor the development of the PHOR-FRONT modules, DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following device areas:\r\n\r\nI.\t1550 nm Coherent Optical Oscillator\r\nThe first major interest of the PHOR-FRONT program is the development and demonstration of a narrow-linewidth, low-noise, high power, frequency-stabilized coherent optical oscillator.  The spectral region of interest for this single frequency laser is the 1550 nm communications band, where a wealth of supporting optoelectronic component infrastructure exists.  In addition to supporting highly linear analog photonic links, the challenging performance specification goals targeted for the laser have been chosen to meet other coherent oscillator application needs.  Innovative semiconductor, solid-state and fiber laser approaches to producing compact laser modules that can meet these challenging performance specifications are solicited.  This area of interest has four sub-tasks:\r\n\r\nA.\tDevelop and demonstrate a narrow-linewidth (less than 10 Hz) single-mode laser design at 1550 nm wavelength that can readily scale in output power (greater than 1 W) and show a path to high wall plug efficiency (greater than 20 percent);\r\n\r\nB.\tIncorporate Amplitude Modulation (AM) & Frequency Modulation (FM) laser noise reduction techniques into the laser design enabling shot-noise-limited performance to be obtained at small frequency offsets from the optical carrier (less than 1 MHz);\r\n\r\nC.\tDevelop and demonstrate a precise high-resolution frequency stabilization method for realizing long-term absolute wavelength stability (less than 100 kHz total excursion); and\r\n\r\nD.\tDemonstrate and deliver the laser performance required to realize the photonic RF front-end receiver NF and SFDR to be demonstrated in conjunction with the second area of interest below.\r\n\r\nThe goal at the end of Phase I of the program (see Program Scope below) is to fabricate and demonstrate a functional coherent optical oscillator, and to demonstrate a design path to increased performance levels.  The Program goal, at the end of Phase II, is to fabricate and demonstrate the optical oscillator with full performance specifications enabling the targeted photonic link SNR, NF and SFDR goals to be achieved in conjunction with the second area of interest below.\r\n\r\nII.\tLinear Optical Phase Demodulator\r\nThe second major area of interest is the design, fabrication and demonstration of a strictly linear optical phase demodulator to be used in conjunction with a linear optical PM transmitter.  Phase demodulation techniques that produce intrinsically linear receiver transfer characteristics, as opposed to relying principally on intermodulation distortion (IMD) cancellation methods, are central to this task.  One possible example of a coherent receiver that falls within the scope of this task area is a balanced mixer optical phase-locked-loop (OPLL) discriminator.  In this case, the OPLL output error signal can be configured to instantaneously track the phase of the input signal, i.e. a linear PM demodulator.  Coherent receivers for 0.5-18 GHz phase modulated optical signals with 500 MHz IBW providing greater than90 dB SFDR are of interest.  Coherent phase-tracking/phase-nulling approaches as well as other novel approaches for achieving strictly linear coherent phase demodulation and downconversion will be considered, provided that detailed analyses and simulations support the RF link performance claims.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note a few considerations pertaining to the envisioned military applications.  The targeted RF antenna applications for space-based, air-borne, maritime or ground-based military platforms dictate that the signal laser (1550 nm coherent optical oscillator) can be remotely co-located with the receiver optoelectronics, providing several local oscillator and feedback implementation options that can be explored.  In addition, the use of polarization-maintaining fiber can be assumed for the short antenna/processor fiber runs, eliminating the need for polarization diversity receiver techniques to be considered.  These considerations should simplify the coherent receiver implementation required for this task area.\r\n\r\nThis area of interest has four general sub-tasks:\r\n\r\nA.\tDevelop and demonstrate a phase demodulator design at a wavelength of 1550 nm that provides highly linear (OIP3 greater than +75 dBm) performance in conjunction with a large 1 dB compression-point dynamic range (greater than 175 dB);\r\n\r\nB.\tDevelop receiver and link models to simulate and predict both receiver and link performance levels for given laser and modulator parameters;\r\n\r\nC.  \tIdentify/analyze major sources of noise and nonlinearities in the coherent link that are related to the receiver and incorporate mitigation techniques; and\r\n\r\nD.\tDemonstrate and deliver the coherent optical receiver performance required to realize the photonic RF front-end receiver NF and SFDR to be demonstrated in conjunction with the first area of interest above.\r\n\r\nFor all proposed approaches and implementations, fully functional linear phase demodulation chips/modules are to be developed and demonstrated.  The proposal should provide simulation and analysis depicting the expected link linearity of the proposed approach using 1550 nm laser specifications similar to that being developed in Area I of this solicitation.  Proposals should clearly describe all major parametric dependencies of the link linearity in the system, including system components not addressed in this solicitation (e.g. front-end optical modulator).  The goal at the end of Phase I of the program (see Program Scope below) is to fabricate and demonstrate a functional linear optical phase discriminator, and to demonstrate a design and integration path to increased performance levels.  The Program goal, at the end of Phase II, is to fabricate and demonstrate the optical phase discriminator with full performance specifications enabling the targeted photonic link bandwidth, NF and SFDR goals to be achieved.\r\n\r\nPHOR-FRONT offerors are encouraged to submit innovative proposals that address either or both of the areas of interest, as proposers are not required to address both topics.  Although not a requirement, teaming is encouraged where warranted, especially under Area II which would necessitate integration of various photonic and electronic technologies.\r\n\r\nThe selected performers will be required to deliver individual devices and groups of devices (subsystems) that form analog photonic RF front-end building blocks at appropriate intervals within the program to a DARPA-designated facility.  Offerors are also asked to submit a list and timetable of deliverables.\r\n\r\nAdditional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 05-20 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.\r\n\r\nPROGRAM SCOPE\r\n\r\nThe PHOR-FRONT program will consist of a 15 month Phase I effort with contractor defined Go Ahead critical milestones at the end of 12 months.  This will be followed by a 15-month Phase II option to achieve the full performance targets if not achievable in Phase I.  Clearly stated, quantitative milestones at 12, 21 and 30 months into the program are required.  Offerors are strongly encouraged (Evaluation Criteria (3)) to pursue aggressive development schedules towards meeting the program goals in a most timely manner.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II should include it as an option in their proposal.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming including different expertise such as, but not limited to, design, fabrication, integration and packaging are encouraged, but not required.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.

This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide details about a possible future DARPA program so that industry feedback can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA. Responders are invited to provide comment on any or all of the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation in order to ensure that every effort is made to address this important problem. Responses to this request may be used to support development of and, subsequently, be incorporated within a future DARPA Program BAA, to the extent any such information is available for public distribution.\r\n\r\nThe following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhased array antennas are crucial to current and future military systems operating from radio frequencies, to microwave, to millimeter-wave frequencies.\r\n\r\nThis RFI takes both a top-down and bottom-up approach to the technologies and components needed to enable the next generation of phased arrays, which for this RFI includes correlation arrays and interferometers.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this RFI concentrates on two aspects of the phased array antennas: 1) in light of envisioned phased array capabilities and applications, what technologies or components are needed; and 2) assessing and advancing the state of beamforming for RF systems.\r\n\r\nThis RFI solicits respondents to submit ideas related to either or both aspects keeping in mind, however, that any resulting DARPA program would be looking beyond research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.\r\n\r\nThe first aspect of this RFI pertains to system level needs for phased array performance and capabilities.\r\n\r\nHere DARPA seeks examples of revolutionary approaches, architectures and applications.\r\n\r\nRespondents should clearly articulate the deficiency or new capability being addressed.\r\n\r\nA flow down of system level requirements to the component or module level is preferred, but not required.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this first aspect is to present and illustrate the need being addressed or new capability being enabled by the development and demonstration of new technologies, components, and modules.\r\n\r\nDARPA's vision is to stimulate technology innovations that would culminate in module-level proof-of-concept demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThe second aspect of this RFI deals with beamforming. To truly harness the power of phased arrays, and enable the very broad bandwidth potential, it is imperative to employ best-in-class beamforming architectures for any given application.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this context, true-time delay (TTD) based beamformers are far superior when compared to their phase shifter based counterparts. Through this RFI, DARPA is soliciting ideas for developing component and module level technologies to support compact and ultra-compact beamforming architectures for phased array antenna systems operating in frequency bands within the range 1 to 100 GHz. Of particular interest to DARPA are technologies and solutions that afford multi-octave bandwidth operation while concurrently enabling multiple beams in different frequency bands from the same aperture. DARPA has significant interest in considering novel beamforming modules and architectures that substantially reduce the size, weight, and power (SWAP) of phased array antenna systems.\r\n\r\nTechnologies that significantly reduce precious aperture wall-plug power are particularly attractive. Approaches to address this problem may include the processing of received signals at a location that is remote from the antenna aperture.\r\n\r\nDARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. DARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, affordability, weight, size and power requirements of the proposed approach. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received.\r\n\r\nResponses should be limited to three pages for any given concept. Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such.\r\n\r\nInput on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. For all RFI responses, an additional, non-proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact and contact information. In order to comply with scheduling priorities, responders are asked to provide feedback by no later than 2:00pm (Eastern) April 18, 2008.\r\n\r\nRFI Responses should be submitted in a commonly used electronic format and may be e-mailed or mailed on a CD-ROM to: Dr. Ronald Esman, Program Manager (Primary RFI Technical Point of Contact), DARPA/MTO, 3701 N Fairfax Dr. Arlington, VA 22203.

Fairfax Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, Virginia, 22203 from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m..  Registration begins at 8:00 a.m. and the conference will start promptly at 9:00 a.m.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the LR-ASM program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to meet to discuss teaming opportunities.  Any questions related to this announcement should be sent to BAA08-41@darpa.mil.\r\n\r\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:\r\nThe Long Range Anti-Ship Missile Demonstration program is a joint DARPA/ONR effort to rapidly develop and demonstrate a ship launched standoff anti-ship strike weapon capable of achieving mission kill against selective surface targets at significant standoff ranges.  The program will develop technologies that enable U.S. surface platforms to engage other surface units from well outside counter-fire ranges, with inherent capability to ensure weapon survivability against advanced defensive systems.  The program should achieve robust integrated flight test of a prototype system no later than three years after contract award.  Proposers will be encouraged to provide best performance solutions based on innovative application of technologies that can realistically achieve flight status within this timeframe.  Consideration should be given to innovative terminal survivability and lethality approaches that are effective against current and projected ship defensive systems.\r\n\r\nThe Government envisions a two phase development program.  Phase 1 will fully develop system concepts, generate preliminary system designs, estimate procurement and lifecycle costs, and support government analytical evaluation of design effectiveness.  This phase, approximately nine (9) months in duration, will culminate in a preliminary design review (PDR) and independent technical assessment.  Phase 2 will progress through detail design, component maturation and testing, system integration including subsystem verification testing, flight test planning, long lead procurement, and a critical design review (CDR).  Upon successful completion of a CDR, Phase 2 will continue with final system fabrication, integration, and testing as required to achieve a full-scale flight test and integrated demonstration of kinematic performance, guidance, target discrimination and acquisition, terminal survivability techniques, and warhead lethality.  It is strongly desired that the full effort, including the integrated demonstration, be completed within thirty-six (36) months from contract award.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION INFORMATION:\r\nParticipants must register no later than April 30, 2008 at the following website: www.schafertmd.com/conference/LRASM.  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  If space limitations are approached, organizations may be asked to limit attendance.\r\n\r\nThe May 6th industry day conference will be classified at the DoD secret level.  Visitors must check in at Schafer reception in Suite 400.  Visitors will not be admitted without proper photo identification and a current visit request on file.  Please see the security link on the registration website for details.\r\n\r\nThe latter portion of the industry day will be set aside to allow attendees to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and discuss teaming opportunities with the industry audience.  Upon arrival, the attendees will receive their scheduled time for presenting.  The opportunity to present will be afforded on a first come, first served basis.  It is the presenter\u2019s responsibility to ensure that all proposed material, whether unclassified, classified, or otherwise sensitive, is reviewed prior to being displayed at the conference by the organization that funded the effort.  Presentations will be limited to ten (10) minutes each.\r\n\r\nProposers desiring to present at the industry day conference should send an electronic copy of all unclassified material to be presented to BAA08-41@darpa.mil as soon as possible, but no later than May 2, 2008.

Technologies that improve the SKB energy balance problem can be categorized as:  (1) technologies that more effectively enable the SKB to harvest / harness the available energy; (2) technologies that allow the SKB to operate more efficiently (use less energy); and (3) technologies that allow the SKB to store more energy.\r\n\u2022\tSurviving high wind and high sea state conditions. Technologies that could improve the SKB operational survivability can be categorized as:  (1) technologies for short-term weather event survivability that could improve the chance of the SKB surviving extreme weather events that might otherwise damage or capsize the SKB; and (2) technologies for long term operational reliability.\r\n\r\nDARPA desires to investigate component technologies that enable a positive energy balance over an extended period and can survive variable and extreme maritime environments; or system concepts with alternative energy harvesting technologies that maintain a positive energy balance, are robust enough to sustain  when ocean conditions are not favorable for an energy harvesting modality (limited solar radiation, no wind, or no waves), and can survive extreme environments.  SKB system attributes include:\r\n\u2022\tSKB endurance: minimum 4 weeks\r\n\u2022\tStation keeping watch circle: smallest possible while maintaining positive energy balance\r\n\u2022\tOperate up to Beaufort scale 6 (22 \u2013 27 kts wind; 10 ft waves)\r\n\u2022\tSurvive up to Beaufort scale 10 (48 \u2013 55 kts wind; 30 ft waves)\r\n\u2022\tSize when stored:  Not greater than 1-foot diameter and 8.5 feet long)\r\n\u2022\tOcean sensing at depths of 100-400 feet\r\n\r\nDARPA is interested in assessing new ideas and concepts in the above areas to support persistence ocean surveillance with station-keeping buoys in anticipation of future investments.  Technologies should represent a fundamental change vice incremental improvements over the status quo, based on an appropriate figure of merit.  Organizations are invited to submit a white paper (including 1 page with Executive Summary and Key Idea, 1-slide briefing chart with concept graphic, and 3-4 pages with supporting technical discussion) to the contracting office as early as possible, but not later than 21 August 2008.

The DiscRotor concept is an aircraft with a relatively small hub-mounted disc that can extend rotor blades to affect vertical flight. The Boeing Company conducted a \u201cPhase 0\u201d (DARPA Seedling/Concept Study) DiscRotor research effort under Contract No. HR0011-07-C-0076. The Boeing Company\u2019s Phase 0 effort was competitively selected in response to DARPA BAA 06-15 \u201cTactical Technology Office\u201d (Office-wide).  Under this Phase 0 contract, The Boeing Company, teamed with Virginia Polytechnical Institute, conducted DiscRotor trade studies, design refinement, mechanical systems conceptual layout, wind tunnel testing, hover rig testing, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and risk reduction planning, providing an initial assessment of performance and flying qualities. The proposed DiscRotor Phase I Program effort is a logical follow-on to the prior effort conducted by The Boeing Company and the Virginia Polytechnical Institute and will also lean on lessons learned from The Boeing Company\u2019s earlier Canard Rotor Wing (CRW) program. Phase I will conduct enabling technology demonstrations \u2013 including wind tunnel testing of a small scale (manually) extendable rotor system and, subsequently, a large scale (automatically) extendable rotor system \u2013 in order to establish critical feasibility of the DiscRotor concept. Additionally, the Boeing Company team will conduct DiscRotor configuration and performance refinement, consider mission survivability issues, and develop options for a flying DiscRotor demonstrator. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 \u201cOnly one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.\u201d  As the developer of the DiscRotor concept, The Boeing Company team possesses unique knowledge, capabilities and proprietary intellectual property/data required to carry out the required research effort.

Situated underwater, Hydra will use modular payloads within a standardized enclosure to enable scalable, cost-effective deployment of rapid response assets and will integrate existing and emerging technologies in new ways to create an alternate means of delivering a variety of payloads close to the point of use. The Hydra program seeks to develop and demonstrate initial examples of air and undersea payloads while leaving open the potential for accommodating additional payloads in the future.\r\n\r\nThe rising number of ungoverned states, piracy, and proliferation of sophisticated defenses severely stretches current resources and impacts the nation's ability to conduct special operations and contingency missions. The Hydra program represents a cost effective way to add undersea capacity that can be tailored to support each mission. Hydra's communications suite could allow synergistic function with manned platforms, thus increasing their effectiveness, or could allow remote control from over-the-horizon. Technologies are intended to be adaptable to multiple delivery options, including airborne, surface, and subsurface. The Hydra program will enable other new capabilities not currently performed from undersea.\r\n\r\nSee the attached BAA for complete program details and proposal submission instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\nSep 10, 2013 10:32 am\r\nThis amendment incorporates Hydra DD Form 254 (Revised September 9, 2013), which supersedes the previous version attached on August 22, 2013.\r\nAdded:\r\nSep 23, 2013 11:56 am\r\nThe revised BAA (Rev 1) makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n1.
